				<h1>Git-Hub Branching</h1>
				<p>Git-Hub Branching is a way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.</p>
				<p>By default your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch.
					We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.</p>
				<p>When you create a branch off the main branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at
					that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your
					branch, you could pull in those updates.</p>
				<p>Once you have commited your changes to your branch, you can open a pull request. Pull requests let
					you tell others about changes you’ve pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull
					request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add
					follow-up commits before your changes are merged into main.</p>
				<p>By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from
					specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.</p>
				<p>After your pull request has been merged, you can pull the changes from main into your local branch
					and delete the extra branch you’ve been working on.</p>
				<p>Branches are an important part of the GitHub flow, a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports
					teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. For more information, see "GitHub flow."
